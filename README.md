# How run on Synology NAS Docker

Install `Docker` Package in Synology `Package Center`, run Docker and search my Docker Image `herowinb/live-dl` in Registry tab with keyword `live-dl`, after download launch Image and edit your config.

 * Execute container using high privilege
 * Enable Auto-restart

Download [Zip](https://github.com/herowinb/live-dl/archive/master.zip) and unzip `Config` folder, rename `config.example.yml` to `config.yml` and edit.

Edit `auto.sh`, remove # and change channel URL. Now you can startup `live-dl` to monitor and download upcoming live stream from your ~~Waifu~~ Vtuber.

Edit `keyword.txt`, only download if match with keyword filter, using `\|` between 2 keywords

After finish your config, run your new Container.

Use live-dl

You can run this script in background (manually):

```shell
# Start process
nohup bash live-dl https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1opHUrw8rvnsadT-iGp7Cg &>/tmp/live-dl-minatoaqua.log &

# View processes
ps aux | grep live-dl
501 94552   964   0  9:38PM ttys009    0:00.06 bash live-dl https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1opHUrw8rvnsadT-iGp7Cg
501 94765   964   0  9:39PM ttys009    0:00.00 grep live-dl

# Stop process
kill 94552
```

## How update new image docker (new live-dl) on Synology NAS Docker

Search my Docker Image `herowinb/live-dl` in Registry tab with keyword `live-dl`. Wait to complete download new image.
Stop your Container `live-dl` running, update/edit new `config.yml`, `keyword.txt` or new config file … (if need). On your Container `live-dl` select Action and Clear then Start your Container again, it will update to new Image `live-dl`.

## How monitor member only stream

This feature help who joined membership but cannot watch live (time zone problem, busy with work or life) but don't want to miss out un-archive member only streams. Please remember that SHARING with non-members is **PROHIBITED**.

You need to login YouTube with an account joined membership of the channel to monitor, then export `cookies.txt` (for Youtube.com only) using the [Firefox addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookies-txt/) or [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/get-cookiestxt/bgaddhkoddajcdgocldbbfleckgcbcid?hl=en). Rename to `cookies_membership.txt` and move it to `config` folder.

Note:
  * You should **NOT** replace your `cookies.txt` with `cookies.txt` generated by `live-dl`. You can use `LONG INTERVAL` below to avoid YouTube seeing your account as a bot.
  * You can not take archive chat with member only stream.
  * Cookies may expire after a while of use and you need to update/replace it. A warning message will be sent via discord if cookies are expired.
  * Live-dl can not detect member-only Video ID if the channel owner make [a public post instead of member only post ](https://www.youtube.com/post/UgxxvD4zekOaMpnPshJ4AaABCQ) on the community tab. So I add option `-mb` to manual monitor/download.

  ```shell
  live-dl -mb https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxxxxxx
  ```

## How use long interval

New option `LONG INTERVAL` in `config.yml`, it helps live-dl not run too much. If detect upcoming time longer than `LONG INTERVAL`, live-dl will use `LONG INTERVAL`.

You should set `LONG INTERVAL` between 600 (10 minutes) and 1800 (30 minutes) to make sure `live-dl` not miss guerrilla/RTA stream.

```shell
live-dl -i 60 -li 900 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxxxxxxxxxxxx/community
```

## How use Discord notification

Push notification via Discord DM. If you want to push notification for a channel, please use Pingcord.

Create an Application and a Bot at https://discord.com/developers/, copy Bot token to `config.yml` file. Because Bot can not create a DM to User at first time and User can not add friend or find Bot to make a DM, you need follow this:
* Create a temp Discord server, add your Bot to temp server (change xxxx = client ID in application) https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=xxxx&scope=applications.commands
* Click to Bot on Server User list (right panel) and send a Private Message to bot
* Open https://discord.com/channels/@me/ on browser, select your Bot and copy channel ID (numbers after /@me/, put **between two `"`**) in to `config.yml` file
* You can delete temp Discord server
